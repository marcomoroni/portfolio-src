I hope you're enjoying this simple website because I took care of every little corner.

I like minimalism, and you've probably noticed. I used warm colours and only one accent colour (orange) for interactable elements.

The abstract (or title) of each portfolio entry uses a monospace font: a simple heading would not be enough to recognize this element throughout the site.

The navigation is at the bottom of each page, starting from the home. By following it, the user can have a look at all my works in one go. The content of these pages is simple and concise with big pictures. This is so because the user is most likely an employer, and they have a bunch of other portfolios waiting after mine. *Isn't that right, mr. employer?*

I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build it from the ground up. I'm not a web developer but hey, it came out pretty good!
