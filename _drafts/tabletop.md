`In progress!` Now, let's try add `some` code. And then I'l write a lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot lot of things so I check how another piece code looks on a `new line`.

What if
```
I have a block {

  // In progress!
  and I have a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong line
}
```
and I have to `style` it?
