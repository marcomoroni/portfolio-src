  <p>A tabletop engine with fancy tools for developers.</p>

  <p>This is a tabletop engine made with <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>: a player can drag-and-drop cards across different <em>decks</em> (a <em>deck</em> is considered a collection of cards that can be laid down in different ways). A developer should be able to easily set up a scene for any board game (not <em>any</em> but you get the point). To help out developers I built some tools to arrange the scene using the powerful feature of the Unity Editor.</p>

<p>The Unity Package with a short guide is <a href="https://github.com/marcomoroni/set10110">on GitHub</a>. It’s not <em>complete</em>, but it should work for simple games.</p>

<p>This project made me realize how much I enjoy tools development and playing around with the Unity editor. Tools are extremely important especially for big games, and with them I can even do some UX design that I like so much!</p>

<h3 id="tabletop-engine">Tabletop engine</h3>

<p>The engine based around two concepts: <em>cards</em> and <em>decks</em>.</p>

<p>A deck takes a <code class="highlighter-rouge">TabletopDeckStyle</code> Scriptable Object as a parameter: it contains the data on how the cards should be placed on the table. <code class="highlighter-rouge">TabletopDeckStyle</code> can be a line or a circle and from the Inspector is possible to change many variable, for example the gap between cards, the max scatter (position and angle), the alignment, etc.</p>

<p>Cards can be moved around with your cursor or by using simple functions like <code class="highlighter-rouge">AddCard()</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">AddCards()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="developer-tools">Developer tools</h3>

<p>I build a handy Editor Window to manage the cards that will be added to the scene; it was soon clear that that was most necessary tool to have, otherwise every card should have been changed individually. It consists on a database where cards can be added, deleted or duplicated. Once they are ready you only need to click on “Update Scene” to create the cards. The <em>default</em> values are the ones a new card will have when added. For example, if every card has the same back sprite, set it as default, and every new card will have it.</p>

<p>Decks have Gizmos to show where cards will be placed once in Game mode. These are always visible and if a deck is selected the gizmos will change color. The whitest gizmo box corresponds to the first (or top) card of a deck.</p>

<p>Also, all Inspectors are custom made to allow more functionalities and better UI.</p>

<p><em>Note that I’m working on <a href="https://github.com/marcomoroni/onirim">a proper board game engine</a> and I want to implement <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156336/onirim-second-edition">Onirim</a> soon. Also when I did this project I didn’t know about events and delegates = could have been much better.</em></p>
