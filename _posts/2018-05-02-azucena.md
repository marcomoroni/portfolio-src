*Azucena* has been my first complete game. [This is its website](https://marcomoroni.github.io/azucena/)!

I made this game as a university coursework, and the project included a pitch presentation and a game design document.

I took inspiration mainly from two games: *The Legend of Zelda* and *[Hyper Light Drifter](http://www.heart-machine.com/)*. You play as Azucena, a llama who has to rescue her three babies. Each of them are waiting for you at the end of a level and they can be visited in any order.

It runs on an engine built from scratch in C++, with the help of [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D). The pieces are the same you would expect to find in any game engine: scenes, entities, components, etc. The game has all the basic technical feature necessary to consider a game *a game*, for example: a menu, save and load, a tutorial, and ending, sounds and music, support for different screen resolutions, remappable controls and joystick support.

The source code is [here](https://github.com/marcomoroni/azucena).
