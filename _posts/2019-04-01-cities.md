This was my Honours Project for my degree in Games Development at Edinburgh Napier University. The most interesting part was discovering that procedural art is actually a thing. And it's addicting.

The project was divided in two parts. First, I studied and classified the different procedural content generation (PCG) techniques. Then, I picked some of them so to create a generator in Unity that would create cities similar to the ones drawn by [Minna O.](https://nokkasili.tumblr.com/):

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.assets_folder }}/minna05.jpg)

These are some screenshots of the generated artefacts, which is in 3D and interactive. The third one has on orthographic projection, which I think looks better when you can only see an image (and not interact with the scene). I was extremely lucky to have the artist helping me  throughout the project: she made the assets used for the final system:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.assets_folder }}/ortho-01.png)

Needless to say, the final result is way more limited than initially imagined, however I'm extremely happy with what I've learnt, as this was my first time delving into PCG.

You can try the generator online [here](https://marcomoroni.itch.io/architect), and if you want to learn more about how I did it, keep reading!

### Classification

PCG techniques can be divided in two categories:

* additive techniques, where the artefacts are created: goblins and treasures are placed in a map, the loot of a chest is created, etc.;
* substractive techniques, where the artefacts are filtered: the generator (or sometimes a human) needs to evaluate what has been produced and pick the correct or best ones.

Here, I covered only additive techniques, and even so, the list of them is far from comprehensive. I described some of the most used algorithms, and I focused on the ones that I actually used. Here's a short summary of the additive PCG algorithms:

* Tiles: As the name suggests, when you have a bunch of equally sized tiles you can place them around following certain rules.
* Grammars: These techniques usually consist on a set of rewriting rules, for example, if I have a rule such as *A &#8594; AB*, I can iteratively expand a string *A* in *AAB*, *ABABB* *ABBABBB*, etc. This is called an L-system, and it was initially developed to describe how plants look. Fractal are also a type of grammar.
* Distribution: Let's say you need to populate a map with trees, you may want them to be at a certain distance from each other, or you may to have more of them in certain areas. You can use distribution techniques, which give you more control over randomness.
* Parametric: Not really algorithm by itself, it usually refers to generators that can be controlled though parameters.
* Interpretative: 2D Perlin noise can be interpreted as a black and white texture, which can then be used to create a terrain mesh.
* Simulations: Yeah no, that involves things like neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, which are way out of the scope of this project.

### Techniques used

For every category I identified their strengths and weaknesses, and then I picked the ones that better suited what I wanted to achieve.

A city is made of multiple 2D layers in the *z*-axis. Each layer is essentially a list of `BUILDING`, `TREE`, `BRIDGE`, `EMPTY_SPACE`, etc., and this list is populated using a Markov chain, which is a distribution technique. The idea of a Markov chain is simple: the probability to pick a certain item depends on the preceding item, and these probabilities are represented with a *transition matrix*, in which each cell contain the probability to have a item in a column after an item in a row. Using this method is possible to code rules such as "a bridge must be between two buildings" by (1) having the probability to pick a bridge > 0 only after a building and (2) having a probability of 100% to pick a building after a bridge.

Next, I used L-systems to compose the buildings as a stack of blocks (like a LEGO construction). Similarly to Markov chains, L-systems are a list of items, but in this case the list gets expanded through following a set of *production rules*. Unfortunately, I only used this algorithm in its simplest form to expand a building until it reached a certain height (the list would be something like `<block><block><block><block><roof>`), but I discovered how powerful they could be, in particular, as I wrote earlier, imagine what if in a rule such as *A &#8594; AB*, *A* and *B* were shapes---the buildings could have much more complex shapes, [I would only need a procedural texture to fill it with]({{ site.baseurl }}/watercolour)!

Finally, the system is ultimately parametric, and the parameters change either the transition matrix of the Markov chain or the production rules of the L-system.

### Other things I've learnt but I didn't use

Where to even start?

Definitely the biggest thing that I didn't manage to implement were procedurally generated textures. Those would have allowed so much more diversity: the could fill any shape and have use many colour combinations. Being now a Google Search sensei I discovered what most procedural artist have in their toolbox: [Processing](https://processing.org/), noise, noise with one more dimension so to have looping noise, normal distribution, just to name a few.

Shape grammars. Yeah, I would start from scratch with that.

Honestly, if you've never done it, just search for "procedural art", finding new algorithms is like opening Christmas presents.
