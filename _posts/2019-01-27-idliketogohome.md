I made *I'd like to go home* during the 48h of the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) 2019. [Play it on itch.io](https://marcomoroni.itch.io/id-like-to-go-home)!

This year I decided to go all solo: I draw the assets and I used [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) to build it. It's made with 2D sprites in a 3D side-scrolling scene.

It's a short story about a rabbit that lost his way home. My attention was all on the *feelings* and *immersion* of the player and the art-style was inspired by [Jon Klassen](http://jonklassen.tumblr.com/)---for the characters and the story---and [Gal Shir](https://galshir.com/)---for the colurs and the vegetation.

All the code is in [here](https://github.com/marcomoroni/ggj-2019), and you play online [on itch.io](https://marcomoroni.itch.io/id-like-to-go-home).
