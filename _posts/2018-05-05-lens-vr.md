This experimental VR application lets you navigate through a dataset. One of the controllers is a lens that distorts what you see and magnifies a certain area.

I worked in a team of six people, and my task was the importation and visualization of the datasets in the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) engine. For this demonstration we used data representing the revenue of different films. It is possible to read the details of each point in the other controller.
