This is the clock you can find on my phone home screen. I made it using *[KWLP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.wallpaper&hl=en_GB)* and it was inspired by the Prague astronomical clock (that you can see above) and possibly by Dumbledore's pocket watch.

Here's all the informations it gives me:
* hours (12h and 24h format)
* minutes
* seconds
* year
* month
* day of the month
* day of the week
* sunrise time
* sunset time
* season
* zodiac
* moon luminosity
* whether the phone is charging
* battery level
* number of events on my calendar today

Here's how it works:
