  <p>This was my Honours Project for my degree in Games Development at Edinburgh Napier University. The most interesting part was discovering that procedural art is actually a thing. And it’s addicting.</p>

<p>The project was divided in two parts. First, I studied and classified the different procedural content generation (PCG) techniques. Then, I picked some of them so to create a generator in Unity that would create cities similar to the ones drawn by <a href="https://nokkasili.tumblr.com/">Minna O.</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/portfolio/assets/cities/minna02.jpg" alt="" />

<img src="/portfolio/assets/cities/minna04.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="/portfolio/assets/cities/minna05.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>These are some screenshots of the generated artefacts, which is in 3D and interactive. The third one has on orthographic projection, which I think looks better when you can only see an image (and not interact with the scene). I was extremely lucky to have the artist helping me  throughout the project: she made the assets used for the final system:</p>

<p><img src="/portfolio/assets/cities/perspective-01.png" alt="" />
<img src="/portfolio/assets/cities/perspective-03.png" alt="" />
<img src="/portfolio/assets/cities/ortho-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Needless to say, the final result is way more limited than initially imagined, however I’m extremely happy with what I’ve learnt, as this was my first time delving into PCG.</p>

<p>You can try the generator online <a href="https://marcomoroni.itch.io/architect">here</a>, and if you want to learn more about how I did it, keep reading!</p>

<h3 id="classification">Classification</h3>

<p>PCG techniques can be divided in two categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>additive techniques, where the artefacts are created: goblins and treasures are placed in a map, the loot of a chest is created, etc.;</li>
  <li>substractive techniques, where the artefacts are filtered: the generator (or sometimes a human) needs to evaluate what has been produced and pick the correct or best ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I covered only additive techniques, and even so, the list of them is far from comprehensive. I described some of the most used algorithms, and I focused on the ones that I actually used. Here’s a short summary of the additive PCG algorithms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tiles: As the name suggests, when you have a bunch of equally sized tiles you can place them around following certain rules.</li>
  <li>Grammars: These techniques usually consist on a set of rewriting rules, for example, if I have a rule such as <em>A → AB</em>, I can iteratively expand a string <em>A</em> in <em>AAB</em>, <em>ABABB</em> <em>ABBABBB</em>, etc. This is called an L-system, and it was initially developed to describe how plants look. Fractal are also a type of grammar.</li>
  <li>Distribution: Let’s say you need to populate a map with trees, you may want them to be at a certain distance from each other, or you may to have more of them in certain areas. You can use distribution techniques, which give you more control over randomness.</li>
  <li>Parametric: Not really algorithm by itself, it usually refers to generators that can be controlled though parameters.</li>
  <li>Interpretative: 2D Perlin noise can be interpreted as a black and white texture, which can then be used to create a terrain mesh.</li>
  <li>Simulations: Yeah no, that involves things like neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, which are way out of the scope of this project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="techniques-used">Techniques used</h3>

<p>For every category I identified their strengths and weaknesses, and then I picked the ones that better suited what I wanted to achieve.</p>

<p>A city is made of multiple 2D layers in the <em>z</em>-axis. Each layer is essentially a list of <code class="highlighter-rouge">BUILDING</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">TREE</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">BRIDGE</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">EMPTY_SPACE</code>, etc., and this list is populated using a Markov chain, which is a distribution technique. The idea of a Markov chain is simple: the probability to pick a certain item depends on the preceding item, and these probabilities are represented with a <em>transition matrix</em>, in which each cell contain the probability to have a item in a column after an item in a row. Using this method is possible to code rules such as “a bridge must be between two buildings” by (1) having the probability to pick a bridge &gt; 0 only after a building and (2) having a probability of 100% to pick a building after a bridge.</p>

<p>Next, I used L-systems to compose the buildings as a stack of blocks (like a LEGO construction). Similarly to Markov chains, L-systems are a list of items, but in this case the list gets expanded through following a set of <em>production rules</em>. Unfortunately, I only used this algorithm in its simplest form to expand a building until it reached a certain height (the list would be something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;block&gt;&lt;block&gt;&lt;block&gt;&lt;block&gt;&lt;roof&gt;</code>), but I discovered how powerful they could be, in particular, as I wrote earlier, imagine what if in a rule such as <em>A → AB</em>, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> were shapes—the buildings could have much more complex shapes, <a href="/portfolio/watercolour">I would only need a procedural texture to fill it with</a>!</p>

<p>Finally, the system is ultimately parametric, and the parameters change either the transition matrix of the Markov chain or the production rules of the L-system.</p>

<h3 id="other-things-ive-learnt-but-i-didnt-use">Other things I’ve learnt but I didn’t use</h3>

<p>Where to even start?</p>

<p>Definitely the biggest thing that I didn’t manage to implement were procedurally generated textures. Those would have allowed so much more diversity: they could fill any shape and be used with any colour combinations. Being now a Google Search sensei I discovered what most procedural artists have in their toolbox: <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, noise, noise with one more dimension so to have looping noise, normal distribution, just to name a few.</p>

<p>Shape grammars. Yeah, I would start from scratch with that.</p>

<p>Honestly, if you’ve never done it, just search for “procedural art”, finding new algorithms is like opening Christmas presents.</p>
