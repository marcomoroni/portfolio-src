My first commercial project I did while working at Coatsink.

'[Jurassic World Aftermath](https://www.oculus.com/jurassic-world-aftermath/)' is a VR game built in Unity. I worked in many areas, such as the progression system, the minigames scattered around the world, the tool on the player's hand that lets him point at distant objects and interact with them and UI to name a few.

The project bravely tried to use Unity's experimental Data Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS), which introduced me for the first time to data-oriented programming. Not very related, but by extension this led me to discover Rust, the best programming language I've come across so far, and later to [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy), which I hope to use soon.

DOTS takes C# and attempts to mold it into a data-oriented, garbage-collector-free sub-language, which ideally allows for more performant games. Authoring and runtime would now be split in two different parts, and runtime code would now be mostly built using an entity-component-system architecture instead of `GameObject`s. Wether this eventually works well for Unity or not I can't say for sure, but I've surely learned a lot about memory management and the impact of good (or bad) APIs, including comments and documentation.

Working for the first time in such a big team made me change some bad habits I realised I had before, here's some wisdom from a junior programmer: don't commit code thinking you'll have time to go back to it later---make it good the first time; always keep in mind your code is going to be read by someone else---don't wait to add comments; designers (or clients) don't always know what they want---poke them until all is clear; pre-production *is important*. As obvious as they may seem, they are a big deal.

I was very lucky to work on this as my fisrt _important_ project, and maybe even more to have such nice co-workers <3.
