This is a tabletop engine made with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/): a player can drag-and-drop cards across different *decks* (a *deck* is considered a collection of cards that can be laid down in different ways). A developer should be able to easily set up a scene for any board game (not *any* but you get the point). To help out developers I built some tools to arrange the scene using the powerful feature of the Unity Editor.

The Unity Package with a short guide is [on GitHub](https://github.com/marcomoroni/set10110). It's not *complete*, but it should work for simple games.

This project made me realize how much I enjoy tools development and playing around with the Unity editor. Tools are extremely important especially for big games, and with them I can even do some UX design that I like so much!

### Tabletop engine

The engine based around two concepts: *cards* and *decks*.

A deck takes a `TabletopDeckStyle` Scriptable Object as a parameter: it contains the data on how the cards should be placed on the table. `TabletopDeckStyle` can be a line or a circle and from the Inspector is possible to change many variable, for example the gap between cards, the max scatter (position and angle), the alignment, etc.

Cards can be moved around with your cursor or by using simple functions like `AddCard()` or `AddCards()`.

### Developer tools

I build a handy Editor Window to manage the cards that will be added to the scene; it was soon clear that that was most necessary tool to have, otherwise every card should have been changed individually. It consists on a database where cards can be added, deleted or duplicated. Once they are ready you only need to click on "Update Scene" to create the cards. The *default* values are the ones a new card will have when added. For example, if every card has the same back sprite, set it as default, and every new card will have it.

Decks have Gizmos to show where cards will be placed once in Game mode. These are always visible and if a deck is selected the gizmos will change color. The whitest gizmo box corresponds to the first (or top) card of a deck.

Also, all Inspectors are custom made to allow more functionalities and better UI.

*Note that I'm working on [a proper board game engine](https://github.com/marcomoroni/onirim) and I want to implement [Onirim](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156336/onirim-second-edition) soon. Also when I did this project I didn't know about events and delegates = could have been much better.*
